# Homework 3 Repo

This contains all files for Homework 3. index.html and page2.html are part 1(website design), while page3.html and all other files(eg. csvEditFile.py and templates 1 through 3) are all for the visualization components. If hosting locally, home, page 2, and page 3 are all accessible via the navigation menu at the top of the page. As the file names imply, the home page and page 2 are for part 1, while page 3 contains all the visualizations needed for part 2.
